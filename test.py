#find a function to write fibonacci series
#fibonacci series is a series of numbers where a number is the sum of the two numbers before it
#the first two numbers are 0 and 1
#the third number is 0+1=1
#the fourth number is 1+1=2
#the fifth number is 1+2=3
#the sixth number is 2+3=5
#the seventh number is 3+5=8
#the eighth number is 5+8=13
#and so on
#the function should take a single parameter n
#the function should return the nth value in the fibonacci series
#the function should be called fib
#the function should be defined in a separate file called fibonacci.py
#the function should be imported into the current file using the import command
#the function should be called using the dot notation
#the function should be called using the dot notation

import fibonacci
fibonacci.fib(10)
